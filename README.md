# Game-of-Hog
This is the course project from UCB CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is the Game of Hog. 
In this project, simulators and the rules of the dice game Hog were designed, and the corresponding Graphical User Interface was created for users to play a fully interactive version of Hog!
