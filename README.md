# Game-of-Hog
This is the course project from UCB CS 61A: Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs, which is the Game of Hog. 
In this project, simulators and the rules of the dice game Hog were designed, and the corresponding Graphical User Interface was created 
for users to play a fully interactive version of Hog!

Higher ordered functions and control statements were the main techniques in designing and employing game strategies and rules. Feel free
to check them out in the code.

To play the game, double click on the hog_gui.py!

The inner design and game logic are stored in hog.py!
